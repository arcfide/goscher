OVERVIEW
--------

Goscher is a lean Scheme Gopher server currently designed to be run 
under inetd. It only supports basic functionality at the moment, but 
hopefully that will change.

FEATURES
--------

Currently Gopher only supports the display of files in a set hierarchy 
with custom descriptions and user-specified extension to file-type 
mappings.

INSTALLATION
------------

See the INSTALL file.

RUNNING
-------

You should add an entry into your inetd.conf file, and remember to pass 
-q as one of the arguments to the goscher server.

A sample inetd.conf entry might be:

127.0.0.1:gopher	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/bin/goscher goscher -q

CONFIGURATION
-------------

First make sure that /etc/goscher/goscher.conf matches the example, 
and that the host name is correct.

Goscher currently expects to find its data directory in /var/goscher 
and its configuration in /etc/goscher. This will become configurable in 
the future. Right now the only supported goscher configuration files 
are extensions.X files which specify the extensions that map to file 
types. Each extensions file maps a list of extensions to the file type 
'X' which is the last part of the file name, and should be only one 
letter or digit. The extensions are listed one extension per line.

In every directory of the data directory, there can be a +INDEX file, 
which specifies the properties associated with every file in that 
directory. It is formatted as a Scheme S-Expression Association list.

	(("filename" (property . value) ...) 
         ...)

The currently supported properties are:

	name 		Description of file displayed on the entry.
	type		Type of the file in Gopher Terms.

It is possible to tweak the configuration and location of the files, 
but if you change the location of goscher.conf, you must pass this 
file explicitly to the goscher program on launch as the first argument.

SPECIAL FILES
-------------

Other than +INDEX, there are also special files that you can create 
which allow you to do things in Goscher.

GOPHER LINKS (file@): 

	These files contain pair based association lists in Scheme 
	format which allows you to access foreigh gopher servers. 
	They are expected to have at least five attribute:

		name		Printed Name of the entry
		selector	The path on the remote server
		server		Remote host name
		port		Remote port name
		type		Document type in gopher form

	A sample entry would be:

		((name . "Floodgap Server")
 		 (server . "gopher.floodgap.com")
 		 (port . 70)
 		 (selector . "")
 		 (type . 1))
