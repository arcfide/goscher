To install Goscher, you simply need to edit the Makefile with your 
preferred PREFIX and then run "make install" with the appropriate 
permissions. Make sure you install Petite Chez Scheme first.

Goscher currently expects to be installed in the same PREFIX as 
Petite Chez Scheme.

You can download the latest version of Petite Chez Scheme from

INSTALLING A SOURCE VERSION

If you are not compiling Goscher from source, or if you are just 
running from source and can't compile from source or use a 
compiled release, you'll need to install the source files and 
libraries in an appropriate location, and adjust goscher-launch 
to point to this location. You can then run Goscher from the 
source without compiling so long as you install Petite Chez Scheme 
as per the above.
